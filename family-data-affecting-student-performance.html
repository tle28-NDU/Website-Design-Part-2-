        <p class="lead-desc">
          This graph compares student performance on their exam to their family income, separated into three different categories of Low, Medium, and High. The median score across all different categories of income is roughly the same, with high income students scoring 1 point more than the other two groups. Although the median score was relatively the same, both the maximum and minimum score for high income students was the greatest out of all the groups. The low income students had a wider range of scores below the median than the other two groups. Altogether, this data shows that high income students may have a slight advantage when it comes to academic performance. This is likely due to the more easy access to academic resources, less financial anxiety, and more time due to likely not needing to work as much as their less wealthy peers. However, the differences are not drastic.

        <p class="lead-desc">
          This graph compares student performance based on their exam score with their parental education level, along with the amount of hours each student studied. There is an obvious trend upwards when comparing the student’s exam scores with the hours studied, and longer hours studied is positively correlated with exam scores. In terms of looking at the parental education level of the students, if you compare the post-graduate group to the other two at any number of hours studied, the majority of the students with higher scores also had parents with postgraduate educations. For example, in all students who studied for 20 hours, the highest score received was earned by a student with a parent who had a postgraduate degree. However, the graph does not show a definable trend in student performance based on parental education. There are no correlations visible to suggest that children of postgraduate degree holders study longer than their peers or get better scores, meaning that in terms of parental education, most students are on a relatively even playing field.

        <div class="section-title">Parental Involvement vs Exam Score</div>
        <p class="lead-desc">
          This graph compares student performance to the parental involvement level. It also includes a comparison between the amount of tutoring sessions received and exam scores. The most obvious difference is that as tutoring sessions increase, so do exam scores. Another notable difference is that the median scores were slightly higher in students with high parental involvement. The minimum scores of high parental involvement students were also slightly higher than the minimum scores of the other two groups. These differences become even more noticeable as tutoring sessions increase, usually peaking at 6 tutoring sessions attended before beginning to dip again. This is likely caused by the fact that students needing lots of tutoring sessions also tend to be students struggling more with grades, across all groups.
